          <div class="content" style="font-size: medium;">The battle begins when you open your eyes<br>
            And continues until you close them at night<br>
            Sometimes not even then does it end because these feelings carry on into your dreaming<br>
            Only for you to wake up and to begin again<br>
            Your enemy is yourself<br>
            And also, not yourself, see<br>
            Anxiety's hard to explain<br>
            Depression's more than just one bad day<br>
            And men and mental illness have never really understood each anyway so here's the gist:<br>
            Your enemy is an invisible force you can only really fight through metaphors<br>
            You're in a sword fight<br>
            With your own foresight<br>
            Every victory hidden from public eye<br>
            Every wound you take yields an invisible cry<br>
            It's a beast you can't kill but it's one you can fight<br>
            And maybe with some words you can soften the bite, cause<br>
            Depression is a lion you've been locked in a cage with, and somebody threw away the key<br>
            You're in a roman coliseum and there's nowhere to flee<br>
            The whole world is watching but nobody's helping<br>
            And you're a fighter, it's true, but now you worry<br>
            Cause you're a worrier<br>
            But you're a warrior<br>
            And you worry<br>
            But you fight <br>
            So here's my advice: punch the lion in the mouth<br>
            Normally you don't condone violence, but for depression you make an exception<br>
            A quick right hook should teach it a lesson, and if it doesn't?<br>
            Let it come back for seconds, cause you are champion<br>
            The fact that you're still standing, still here, still alive, proves that you have the drive and the words to survive<br>
            With anxiety, life's a racehorse you never wanted to ride<br>
            And as you hang on for dear life you here something inside say "let go"<br>
            But you're better than suicide<br>
            Mind addled, every social encounter an uphill battle<br>
            Heart beats so fast it's hard to handle<br>
            Life bucks and tries to throw you off the saddle<br>
            But you grit your teeth and straddle<br>
            Hold on tight, not cause it's wrong or right<br>
            But cause deep down in your scarred heart there's a warrior inside<br>
            You've been a fighter since birth, and never believed in your own worth<br>
            You've got a punch that can shake the Earth<br>
            I won't say you've won but you've survived the day, you've beat back depression in your very own way<br>
            You've cut a path through the needless pain and sorrow<br>
            Get some rest; you've earned it. Then do the same thing tomorrow.</div>
